# Gomuku is a type of 2 player board game and also known as 5 in a row. Here is the wikipedia link,
where the game rules are more detailed.

### Run the code ###
fordit.bat is used for compiling and running the code. At this version of the program, the size of
  the game board can only be changed by the source code. Also the engine can only be switched on/off
  in the source. Furthermore the engine plays randomly.
  The program checks winning patterns horizontally, vertically and diagonally, and highlights them.
  
### Test negamax algorithm ###
run.bat is for testing the negamax algorithm. This algorithm will swap the current random playing.
